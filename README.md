# Numpy-Arrays-Python
Numpy is a popular Python library used for scientific computing. It provides support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.

# Methods
The scripts in this repository demonstrate the usage of the following Numpy methods:

np.zeros(): Creates an array filled with zeros.

np.ones(): Creates an array filled with ones.

np.random.rand(): Creates an array of random values.

np.arange(): Creates an array with a sequence of numbers.

array.sum(): Calculates the sum of all elements in an array.

array.mean(): Calculates the mean of all elements in an array.

array.std(): Calculates the standard deviation of all elements in an array.

array.min(): Finds the minimum value in an array.

array.max(): Finds the maximum value in an array.

array.reshape(): Reshapes an array into a new shape.

array.transpose(): Transposes an array.

np.dot(): Calculates the dot product of two arrays.

np.linalg.det(): Calculates the determinant of an array.

array[index]: Indexes an array at a specific location.

array[start:stop]: Slices an array from a start index to a stop index.

array[bool_array]: Indexes an array using a boolean array.

np.broadcast(): Performs broadcasting on arrays.

Universal functions: np.sin(), np.cos(), np.exp(), and np.log() are examples of universal functions that operate element-wise on arrays.

# Conclusion
Numpy is an essential library for scientific computing in Python. This repository provides a basic understanding of Numpy arrays and their operations.
